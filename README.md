2020 report on the state of political rule and civil society among selected Asia Pacific countries

# Project and report overview

What is the state of democracy today? The question of democratic backsliding and deconsolidation in Western Europe and the United States is a well-documented and actively debated topic. What is the state of political rule and civic space among new(er) democracies and established autocracies in the Asia Pacific? The purpose of this report is to assess the state of political rule and civil society in select countries in the Asia Pacific. The analysis in this report is multilevel and focuses on both political systems/institutions (e.g., how liberal democratic is a country) as well as the individual level (e.g., how supportive are citizens of a democratic political system), with simultaneous consideration where appropriate. 

Using data from the Varieties of Democracy’s country expert evaluations, this report identifies regime types and the degree to which liberal democracy and a robust civil society have been achieved in select Asia Pacific countries since the beginning of the “Third Wave” of democratization (1989-2019). At the individual level, public opinion data from the most recent Asia Barometer (2014-2016) is used to identify a number of attitudes and preferences towards various characteristics of politics and society. Analysis also includes where public opinion and political institutions converge (or diverge) and where significant “youth” opinions differ from the overall population. Lastly, using Varieties of Democracy’s Pandemic Backsliding dataset from May 2020, this report explores the relationship between political order and how freedom-restricting emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been in the Asia Pacific.
